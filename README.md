# Food Desert

## Motivation

Food Desert is a personal project of mine I've been thinking about a while. I wanted to map food security in New York City. I saw that [Mapbox](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) had an [Isochrone feature](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/get-started-isochrone-api/) and I figured this would be a great way to map how grocery store accessibility. This was also an excuse to familiarize myself with [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)

## Tech Stack

This application was constructed using the follow tech stack:

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [react-map-gl](https://visgl.github.io/react-map-gl/)

## Features

A fresh isochrone is generated by clicking anywhere on the map.

In the top right corner you can adjust how far you want to travel as well as if you'd be walking, cycling, or driving.

In the top left corner you can search any address or place of interest.

Hovering your mouse over any of the green points displays the name of the grocery store.
